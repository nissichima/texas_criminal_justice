# Death Row in the State of Texas
The objective of this project is to understand gain a general understanding of death row in the state of Texas. Fortunately, a ton of rich data on this subject is publicly available here:
https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/index.html 

This repository will contain code for scraping and collecting the relevant data for the analysis, as well as the analysis itself. The repo will also contain all the data collected, and hopefully some visualizations.

## Example usage of scraper

```bash
$ git pull https://github.com/nissichima/texas_criminal_justice.git
```

```bash
$ cd /path/to/texas_criminal_justice
```

```bash
$ python code/deathrow.py --filepath /path/to/save/data/file_name.csv
```
Done! Your data should be in the specificed location, saved as a comma-separated file.
